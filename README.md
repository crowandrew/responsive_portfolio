# responsive_portfolio

This is a current work in progress for a portfolio site for Andrew Crow and consists of three separate pages (index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html). It is built using Bootstrap  https://getbootstrap.com/ and custom classes. Additionally, I added a background of a photo I took hiking in the Pacific Northwest and added some icons on the contact page from Font Awesome https://fontawesome.com/.

The About Me page contains a professional image of myself along with text explaining a brief story of how I ended up here today.

The Contact page contains a form element to email me directly and links to my professional social accounts.

Some customization in Style.css
 1. Added background image that spans the height of the viewport.
 2. Added width to the cards in portfolio
 3. Added Opacity to main containers
 4. Changed card width to span viewport when under 576px width
